# Basic Conditional Constructs

 ## if Statement
  
  Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote.")
```

## if-else Statement.

Provides an alternative block if the condition is false.

```python
age = 10
if age <= 12:
    print("Travel for free.")
else:
    print("Pay for ticket.")
```

### elif (Else If)

Checks multiple conditions sequentially.

```python
age = 25
if age <= 12:
    print("Child.")
elif age <= 19:
    print("Teenager.")
elif age <= 35:
    print("Young adult.")
else:
    print("Adult.")
```

## Advanced Forms

### Short-Hand if and if-else
 
Compact syntax for simple conditions.

#### One-line if

```python
age = 19
if age > 18: print("Eligible to Vote.")
```

#### One-line if-else (ternary operator)

```python
marks = 45
res = "Pass" if marks >= 40 else "Fail"
print(f"Result: {res}")
```

#### Nested if-else
Allows checking conditions within conditions.

```python
age = 70
is_member = True

if age >= 60:
    if is_member:
        print("30% senior discount!")
    else:
        print("20% senior discount.")
else:
    print("Not eligible for a senior discount.")
```

#### match-case (Python 3.10+)
Pythonâ€™s version of switch-case.

```python
status = "gold"

match status:
    case "silver":
        print("10% discount")
    case "gold":
        print("20% discount")
    case _:
        print("No discount")
```

#### Matching Multiple Values

Use the | operator to match several values in one case:

```python
def num_check(x):
    match x:
        case 10 | 20 | 30:
            print(f"Matched: {x}")
        case _:
            print("No match found")
```

#### Matching with Conditions (Guards)

You can add if conditions to refine matches:

```python
def describe_day(day, month):
    match day:
        case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 4:
            print("A weekday in April")
        case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 5:
            print("A weekday in May")
        case _:
            print("No match")
```

#### Structural Pattern Matching

match-case can handle complex data types like tuples, lists, and even custom classes:

```python

def process_point(point):
    match point:
        case (0, 0):
            print("Origin")
        case (x, 0):
            print(f"X-axis at {x}")
        case (0, y):
            print(f"Y-axis at {y}")
        case (x, y):
            print(f"Point at ({x}, {y})")
```

## Logical Operators in Conditions

You can combine conditions using:

- and: both conditions must be true

- or: at least one condition must be true

- not: negates the condition

```python

age = 25
is_student = True

if age < 30 and is_student:
    print("Eligible for student discount.")
```
